<h1> Good Morbing Fellow Gamers, welcome to Squid Game 2 </h1>
<p> First Game: Yo Mama joke, <br>
    Whoever said the best Yo Mama joke wins </p>
<p> Yo mama's so fat, when she goes camping, the bears hide their food.</p>
<p> Yo mama's so stupid, she stared at a cup of orange juice for 12 hours because it said "concentrate." </p>
<p> okay gamers, I am bored. Here's a picture of an alligator </p>
